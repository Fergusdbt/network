#### Description: A web application serving as a social media site, featuring JavaScript and JSON
#### Command: python manage.py runserver

This is a project submitted as part of Havard University's CS50w online course. 

This web-based application is uses Python, JavaScript and JSON to provide a fully functioning social media network. Users have the ability to post content and view posts of other users, "like" and "unlike" other posts, edit their own posts, and follow other users. Post edits are handled client-side using JavaScript and JSON to avoid the need to reload pages and provide instant updates. Pages are organised to view all posts, or posts via profile pages or only posts by users that each user is following. With UI/UX in mind, only 10 posts are displayed per page, with pagination deployed to allow users to navigate and view more posts as needed.
